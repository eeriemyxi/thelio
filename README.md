A very plain and simple web app dealing with HTML form data and using a NoSQL database to
store the data. This software is more of a proof of concept kind of thing than an actual
web app.

# Technical Details

For deployment, I use Deno Deploy. They have a free tier.

For the web app my tech stack consisted of:

- Deno (v2.0.0) (runtime)
- Hono (v4.6.5) (web framework)
- Deno KV (database)
